# Food Printing

Course project under Hod Lipson's Digital Manufacturing Course at Columbia University. 

Teams were given simple 3D printers, and the task was 2 fold:

i) Develop software to directly generate the G-Code that could be fed into the printer
ii) Research food materials that could be printed using extrusion

Some videos of the project can be found here - https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0QWMseSNvBXngJ_9VJy7_Utd5qIZotcd

This repository contains the source code for the printing of both the flower as well as the leaves. Please run Main1.m to get started.

Note that all code was written in MATLAB R2016b.
